the Darkpay Core software, see https://darkpay.io.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run darkpay-qt.exe.

Darkpay Core is the original Darkpay client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Darkpay transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
